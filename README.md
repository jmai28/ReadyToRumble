## Problem Statement

What is the Boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure”

## Recursive Abstraction 

When I am asked to  
find the Boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure”  
the recurisve abstraction can  
find the Boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure” in either the north, west, east, or south direction after I have taken one step in some direction.

## Base Case

It is possible to get from the starting position to treasure.

## English or pseudocode description of algorithm
```
if it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure
  record the solution
else \\recursive case
  TBA...
